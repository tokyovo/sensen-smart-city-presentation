## Slide 3: Compliance & Enforcement

### SenForce / SenPIC

**Problem:**
Cities struggle with illegal parking, which causes traffic congestion, reduces parking availability, and creates safety hazards. Manual enforcement is often inefficient and resource-intensive.

**Solution:**
SenForce automates parking enforcement using vehicle-mounted cameras (often incorporating SenPIC) to detect violations automatically. This increases the efficiency and coverage of enforcement, leading to better compliance. The system provides comprehensive evidence reviewed and processed through the SenBOS back-office system.

**Stakeholders:**
- City Councils
- Transportation Authorities
- Parking Management Companies

**End Users:**
- Parking Enforcement Officers
- Back-office Staff

**Pricing:**
- SenForce camera POD: $850/month
- Infringement services: $30,000 p.a. + $3.50/ticket
- Professional Services: $165/hour or $1,320/day

**Pricing Range:** Subscription + Services

## Slide 4: Monitoring & Planning

### SenTAS / SenMAP

**Problem:**
Cities need to understand traffic patterns to manage congestion, plan for future infrastructure, and improve road safety. Traditional monitoring methods can be expensive and may not provide real-time data.

**Solution:**
SenTAS provides real-time traffic analytics using video to count and classify vehicles. This data helps monitor traffic flow and identify congestion. SenMAP can be used to create detailed maps of road assets for planning and maintenance.

**Stakeholders:**
- City Planners
- Traffic Engineers
- Transportation Departments

**End Users:**
- Data Analysts
- Traffic Management Center Operators

**Pricing:**
- SenCOUNT system: $15,000 per system
- System maintenance fee: $2,250 p.a.
- Support and upgrades: $1,200 p.a.

**Pricing Range:** SenCOUNT System Pricing

## Slide 5: Investigation & Security

### SenShield / SenBlue / SenTrack

**Problem:**
Law enforcement and security agencies need to track suspects, investigate crimes, and monitor large areas for security threats, which can be complex and time-consuming with large amounts of video footage.

**Solution:**
SenTrack uses AI to automatically track objects and people across large-scale camera networks, speeding up investigations. SenShield provides a cloud-based security solution (likely ANPR-focused). SenBlue is a developing product that will provide a police intelligence portal.

**Stakeholders:**
- Police Departments
- Law Enforcement Agencies
- Security Companies

**End Users:**
- Investigators
- Security Analysts
- Intelligence Officers

**Pricing:**

## Slide 6: Intelligence & Analytics

### SenBOS / SenSight

**Problem:**
Cities and organizations collect vast amounts of data but often struggle to make sense of it and use it to make better decisions.

**Solution:**
SenBOS provides a central back-office system that integrates with other Sensen products, allowing users to manage data, review violations, and configure the system. SenSight is likely a product that provides advanced analytics and insights from the data collected.

**Stakeholders:**
- City Managers
- Department Heads
- Data Analysts

**End Users:**
